As part of the festivities at the first-ever [GopherCon](http://www.gophercon.com/), I gave a brief talk on what's new with Deis as of April 2014.  [Check out the slides](http://gabrtv.github.io/deis-whatsnew-2014/#/) to learn more.

Here's [Victor Vieux](https://twitter.com/vieux) of the Docker core team rocking his Deis shirt:

Special shout-outs to Victor, [Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower) and the whole [CoreOS](https://coreos.com) team.  Can't wait for next year's GopherCon!
