The Deis team had a great time at [DockerCon](http://dockercon.com)!  A big thanks to Docker, Inc. and all of the sponsors for putting on such an amazing first conference.

It was an honor to speak about Deis - Evolution of a Docker PAAS.  Thank you to all those that attended.  In case you missed it, [here are the slides](http://gabrtv.github.io/deis-dockercon-2014/) (video to come).

The reception to my talk was more than I could have hoped.  I'm sorry I didn't have more time to chat with each of you.  Feel free to [email me directly](mailto:gabriel@opdemand.com).
